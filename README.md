## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox

### What I learned

Throughout this project, I've discovered the transformative power of Flexbox in crafting responsive layouts. Also used some box shadow.

Here's a snippet demonstrating the use of Flexbox and Box shadow,

```css
.card {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  width: 320px;
  height: 497px;
  border-radius: 20px;
  background-color: white;
  box-shadow: 0px 4px 4px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25);
}
```
